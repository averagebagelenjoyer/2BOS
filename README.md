# `FTUIBOS`

`FTUIBOS` stands for Fully Text User Interface Based Operating System. Or simply `2BOS`. Pronounced Two-Boss.


## Installation Process
`2BOS` can be installed via the AUR.

`sudo yay -S 2bos`

If you do not have `yay` installed then run
```
sudo pacman -Syu git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf yay
yay --version
```

*ok well actually this hasn't been added to the AUR yet.*

## Q&A

### How was `2BOS` derived?
Remove the `F`, now you have `TUIBOS`. Seperate `TUI` and `BOS`. In my eyes `TUI` looks like it should sound like `TWO`, and `BOS` should sound like `BOSS`. Therefore, `2BOS` would be a good shortening.

### What is the point?
GUI is easy to use, learn, and understand. CLI is easy to make, fast, and efficient. So why not combine the two?

*"yoooo what if i made the first fully TUI based operating system? ight bet."*
