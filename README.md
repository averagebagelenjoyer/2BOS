# `2BOS`
The *perfect* operating systemâ€”in theory that is.

## Installation Process
`2BOS` can be installed via the AUR.

`yay -S ftuibos`

If you do not have `yay` installed then run
```
sudo pacman -Syu git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf yay
yay --version
```

*ok well actually this hasn't been added to the AUR yet.*

## Q&A

### How was `2BOS` derived?
The original name was, `FTUIBOS`, which standed for Fully Text User Interface Based Operating System.
Remove the `F`, now you have `TUIBOS`. Seperate `TUI` and `BOS`. In my eyes `TUI` looks like it should sound like `TWO`, and `BOS` should sound like `BOSS`. Therefore, `2BOS` would be a good shortening.
And boom, `2BOS` was born.

### What is the point?
GUI is beginner-friendly. CLI is powerful.
TUI is both.

# ???
*"yoooo what if i made the first fully TUI based operating system? ight bet."*
